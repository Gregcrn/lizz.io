We're excited to unveil **Lizz**, the first analytics tool that measures attention instead of just counting clicks. See where your users actually focus. 🎯

## The Problem We're Solving

Traditional web analytics miss the most important metric:

- Page views don't show what users actually read
- Click data doesn't reveal attention patterns
- You're optimizing for visits, not engagement

Lizz changes this by tracking where users actually focus their attention, giving you the insights that matter.

## Our Mission

1. **Measure Real Attention**: Track Section Active Time, not just page views
2. **Understand Content Performance**: See which sections actually engage users
3. **Optimize What Matters**: Make decisions based on attention, not assumptions

## Core Features

- **Section Active Time (SAT)**: How long users actively look at each section
- **Section Completion Rate (SCR)**: How much of your content is actually viewed
- **Attention Quality Score (AQS)**: 0-100 index of section attention quality
- **Drop-off Analysis**: Identify exactly where you lose user attention
- **Privacy-First**: No cookies, no personal data, GDPR compliant

## Why Lizz Is Different

> "Lizz showed us that our most important content was being completely ignored. We moved it up and saw 40% better conversion." - Sarah Chen, UX Director at TechFlow

Stop guessing what users care about. Here's how we compare to traditional analytics:
