# Lizz – Project Brief

## 🎯 Vision
Lizz is an **analytics tool focused on attention**.  
While Google Analytics counts visits and Hotjar shows clicks, **Lizz reveals where users actually focus their attention** on a webpage.

**Tagline:** *See where attention lives.*

## ✨ Unique Value Proposition
- **Attention-first**: Not visits, not clicks — **real attention**.
- **Simplicity**: One snippet, one clear dashboard.
- **Privacy-first**: No cookies, no personal data, GDPR compliant.
- **Clarity**: Actionable metrics, not overwhelming reports.

## 🧭 Target Users
1. **Web agencies & freelancers** → prove design/UX works.
2. **SaaS startups** → understand onboarding drop-offs.
3. **Content creators / blogs** → see what readers actually read.
4. **E-commerce** → identify if product info & CTAs are seen.

## 📊 Core Metrics
- **SAT (Section Active Time)** → how long users actively look at a section.
- **SCR (Section Completion Rate)** → how much of a section is actually viewed.
- **AQS (Attention Quality Score)** → 0–100 index of section attention quality.
- **Drop-off Points** → where users lose attention.
